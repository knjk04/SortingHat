* What is Sorting hat?
  Android app that informs you of your Hogwarts house based on your responses to the questions (a quiz)

  /Please bear in mind that the actual app may look slightly different to the screenshots below if small UI changes are made./
  /If any major UI changes are made, the screenshots will be updated to reflect this./

* Modifying the questions/answers
  - Add/alter your own questions and/or answers in [[https://github.com/knjk04/SortingHat/blob/feature/app/src/main/res/raw/questions.txt][questions.txt]] (click on the link to see the absolute file path)

  Format:
  #+BEGIN_SRC
  Line 1: [question]
  Line 2: [answer 1]
  Line 3: [answer 2]
  Line 4: [answer 3]
  Line 5: [answer 4]
  Line 6: [house that corresponds to answer 1 (note: case insensitive)]
  Line 7: [house that corresponds to answer 2 (note: case insensitive)]
  Line 8: [house that corresponds to answer 3 (note: case insensitive)]
  Line 9: [house that corresponds to answer 4 (note: case insensitive)]
  #+END_SRC

  - Please follow this pattern for subsequent questions. 
  
  Notes:
  - There has to be 4 options currently. Hopefully, this will be changed to be flexible.
    - *This may mean that the format may change. If it does, this section will be updated accordingly*


  - Line breaks are not permitted since it will be mistaken for something else (e.g. answer 1 if on the second line)  

  - Questions and answers (houses, too, but they're short, anyway) can only be on one line. If you have a a very long question
    and decide to break it up over more than one line, the second line will be regarded as answer 1 and the third as answer 2 and so on
