* What is Sorting hat?
  Android app that informs you of your Hogwarts house based on your responses to the questions (a quiz)

  /Please bear in mind that the actual app may look slightly different to the screenshots below if small UI changes are made./
  /If any major UI changes are made, the screenshots will be updated to reflect this./

  Line 1: [question]
  Line 2: [option 1]
  Line 3: [option 2]
  Line 4: [option 3]
  Line 5: [option 4]
  Line 6: [house that corresponds to option 1 (note: case insensitive)]
  Line 7: [house that corresponds to option 2 (note: case insensitive)]
  Line 8: [house that corresponds to option 3 (note: case insensitive)]

  Notes:
  - There has to be 4 options currently. Hopefully, this will be changed to be flexible.

  - Line breaks are not permitted since it will be mistaken for something else (e.g. option 1 if on the second line)
