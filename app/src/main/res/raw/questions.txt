Four boxes are placed before you. Which would you try and open?
The small tortoiseshell box, embellished with gold, inside which some small creature seems to be squeaking.
The gleaming jet black box with a silver lock and key, marked with a mysterious rune that you know to be the mark of Merlin.
The ornate golden casket, standing on clawed feet, whose inscription warns that both secret knowledge and unbearable temptation lie within.
The small pewter box, unassuming and plain, with a scratched message upon it that reads ‘I open only for the worthy.’

One of your house mates has cheated in a Hogwarts exam by using a Self-Spelling Quill. Now he has come top of the class in Charms, beating you into second place. Professor Flitwick is suspicious of what happened. He draws you to one side after his lesson and asks you whether or not your classmate used a forbidden quill. What do you do?
Lie and say you don’t know (but hope that somebody else tells Professor Flitwick the truth).
Tell Professor Flitwick that he ought to ask your classmate (and resolve to tell your classmate that if he doesn’t tell the truth, you will).
Tell Professor Flitwick the truth. If your classmate is prepared to win by cheating, he deserves to be found out. Also, as you are both in the same house, any points he loses will be regained by you, for coming first in his place.
You would not wait to be asked to tell Professor Flitwick the truth. If you knew that somebody was using a forbidden quill, you would tell the teacher before the exam started.

The golden liquid so bright that it hurts the eye, and which makes sunspots dance all around the room
The mysterious black liquid that gleams like ink, and gives off fumes that make you see strange visions.

After you have died, what would you most like people to do when they hear your name?
Miss you, but smile
Ask for more stories about your adventures
Think with admiration of your achievements
I don't care what people think of me after I'm dead; it's what they think of me while I'm alive that counts

A Muggle confronts you and says that they are sure you are a witch or wizard. Do you:
Ask what makes them think so before performing a memory charm on them?
Agree, and ask whether they’d like a free sample of a jinx?
Agree, and walk away, leaving them to wonder whether you are bluffing?
Tell them that you are worried about their mental health, and offer to call a doctor.

Which nightmare would frighten you most?
Standing on top of something very high and realizing suddenly that there are no hand- or footholds, nor any barrier to stop you falling.
An eye at the keyhole of the dark, windowless room in which you are locked.
Waking up to find that neither your friends nor your family have any idea who you are.
Being forced to speak in such a silly voice that hardly anyone can understand you, and everyone laughs at you.

Late at night, walking alone down the street, you hear a peculiar cry that you believe to have a magical source. Do you:
Proceed with caution, keeping one hand on your concealed wand and an eye out for any disturbance?
Draw your wand and try to discover the source of the noise?
Draw your wand and stand your ground?
Withdraw into the shadows to await developments, while mentally reviewing the most appropriate defensive and offensive spells, should trouble occur?
